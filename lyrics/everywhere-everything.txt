Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
It's been a long year
Would we survive in a horror movie?
I doubt it we're too slow moving
We trust everyone we meet
Two bodies riddled with scars from our pre-teens
Intertwine in a car's dirty backseat
And stare at a drive-in screen

We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours

Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Drive slowly, I know every route in this county
Maybe that ain't such a bad thing
I'll tell where not to speed
It's been a long year
And all of our book's pages dog-eared
We'll write out the ends on our palms dear
Then forget to read

We didn't know that the sun was collapsing
'Til the seas rose and the buildings came crashing
We cried oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours

Everywhere, everything, I wanna love you
'Til we're food for the worms to eat
'Til our fingers decompose, keep my hands in yours
